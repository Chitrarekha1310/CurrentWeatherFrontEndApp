Description : (My Notes)
-----

API used : Current Weather API https://openweathermap.org/api
I have opted to use HTML for creating web pages , CSS for styling.
Used Bootstrap for responsiveness of the web application
I have used Chart.js library to create the graph of the forecaste data , for low and high temperature during days calculating from today to upcoming 6 days of the current week .

Overall Experience 
------
Was a refreshing experience Using multiple features like: 
-- <canvas> , <footer> etc. new HTML tags
--calling jQuery functions to retreive JSON data 
--using Javascript objects and DOM selectors
--Implementing Chart.js library
--Including Bootstrap , jquery and other required CDN's to make the website responsive , interactive and user friendly with good styling
